# sudokusolver

GUI that allows numbers to be inputted onto a 9x9 sudoku board and solves it (or displays an X indicating an invalid board).

This application displays a window where you may solve any valid sudoku board. Once opened, you may read the instructions and click start to begin.
Once you start, a 9x9 board will be displayed along with thick or regular lines to show each 3x3 boxes within it.
Here you may click on the boxes to input your numbers in the correct slot. Once you are finished inputting all numbers, you may press Enter to solve the sudoku.
If the inputted board is found to be invalid, a big red 'X' will appear on the window and you may re-enter the numbers once it disappears.
Once the board is solved, you will be given buttons to either start again or exit the program.

There may also be a few invalid boards that will not show the 'X' and will cause the program to be unresponsive. If this does happen, restart the program and input
a valid board.
